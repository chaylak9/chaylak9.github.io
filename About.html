Bernal Heights Neighborhood Center (BHNC) works to preserve and enhance the ethnic, cultural, and economic diversity of Bernal Heights and surrounding neighborhoods.
<br><br>
We promote action to build a just and equitable community for all. BHNC focuses on the needs of people with low and moderate incomes. We accomplish our mission by: developing affordable housing throughout San Francisco; providing linguistically and culturally responsive services to our community's most vulnerable adults, seniors, youth, and their families; developing leaders; and organizing and empowering our tenants, clients, members, and allies to advocate for their needs and for the needs of the community. 
<br><br>
BHNC’s Housing Program works through Bernal Heights Housing Corporation to serves this mission by working throughout the city to provide and preserve stable and affordable homes for adults with low incomes and their children, many of whom are homeless and with special needs due to mental health issues, HIV/AIDS diagnosis, and substance abuse problems.</section></main>
